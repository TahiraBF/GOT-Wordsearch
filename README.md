#Project Week 1: Game

#Concept
The game is Wordsearch based on the traditional wordsearch that is finding full words amongst a grid of apparently random letters.

The game is a one-player game and is completed only when all words listed have been discovered.

#Instructions
The player can select a word in reverse, up-to-down, down-to-up, diagonally and forward. All the letters in the word must be selected in order.

Each time the player thinks he has found a word they must check the word by clicking the "check word" button. If the word is included in the list the list will update and remove the word.
